    <p><h2>The Black Arts Movement is often viewed as the sister to the Black Power Movement and came about during a time of political unrest. The movement sought to provide a corrective to images that were viewed as harmful and attempted to correct these images through the creation of works that centered the black experience, and were revolutionary.</h2></p>

   <p><h2>Although it was primarily a literary movement, the movement's concepts also applied to the visual arts.</h2></p>
